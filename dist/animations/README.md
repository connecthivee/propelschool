# Lottie animations

Add your LottieFiles JSON here for:

- `hero-classroom.json` – Hero section (playful classroom / floating elements)
- `map-pin.json` – Location section pin
- `graduation-cap.json` – Footer
- `classroom.json`, `play.json`, `skills.json`, `communication.json` – Experience panels

Download from [LottieFiles](https://lottiefiles.com) (e.g. education, classroom, map pin, confetti).  
If a file is missing, the app shows a simple placeholder so the layout still works.
